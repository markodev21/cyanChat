# Cyan Chat
This repository contains examples of ChatGPT plugins that demonstrate how to build and deploy plugins on the OpenAI platform. The examples were taken from the [OpenAI Platform documentation](https://platform.openai.com/docs/plugins/examples) and have been added to this repository to make it easier to read and use.

Each example includes a Dockerfile to help with deployment of the plugin. You can use the Dockerfile to build and run the plugin locally or deploy it to a remote server.
